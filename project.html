    <h2>Integrated AI Framework for Agricultural and Environmental Intelligence</h2>
    <figure class="project-figure">
      <img src="images/News/diagram3.png" alt="Integrated AI Framework diagram" width="900" height="auto">
    </figure>
    <p>This project develops a multi-layered AI framework to transform agricultural and environmental data into actionable decision intelligence. The system integrates multimodal sensing—UAV imagery, satellite remote sensing, soil and crop sensors, weather stations, and management records—with advanced machine learning and mechanistic crop and hydrologic models.</p>
    <p>AI-driven data fusion extracts meaningful indicators such as crop stress, soil moisture, nutrient variability, and soil carbon dynamics, while physics-informed hybrid models ensure predictions respect biological and physical processes. These outputs are translated into optimized, scenario-based recommendations for irrigation, nutrient management, conservation, and climate adaptation.</p>
    <p>A climate resilience and stakeholder interface module enables evaluation under extreme events and facilitates iterative feedback from farmers, extension specialists, and environmental managers. Scalable from field to regional levels, the framework advances precision agriculture, improves resource efficiency, strengthens ecosystem resilience, and serves as a platform for interdisciplinary AI innovation.</p>
